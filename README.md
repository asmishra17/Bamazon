**#Bamazon**

In this application, I created an **Amazon-like** storefront using *MySQL* and *JavaScript*. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.  

See below for screenshots of the application at work! 

The beginning of the "Bamazon Customer View". The customer is able to see all products in inventory.
