**#Bamazon**

In this application, I created an **Amazon-like** storefront using *MySQL* and *JavaScript*. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.  

See below for screenshots of the application at work! 

The beginning of the **"Bamazon Customer View"**: the customer is able to see all products in inventory.

Next, the customer chooses an item and amount before viewing their total.

However, if the customer requests more units of the products than there are in inventory, she will get an "Insufficient quantity!" error message.

The application also features a **"Bamazon Manager View"**. The manager begins by viewing a menu containing command options.

*"View Products for Sale"* displays the following:
